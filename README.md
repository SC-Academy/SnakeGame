# SnakeGame

<b>About the game</b></br>
This is a simple snake game written in C++. The goal of the game is to control the snake and eat as 
many food items as possible. The snake will grow longer each time it eats a food item. If the snake hits itself 
or the edge of the screen, the game will end.
